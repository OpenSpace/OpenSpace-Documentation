DU Version 10.6.<br> The Sloan Digital\n      Sky Survey (SDSS) is an ambitious project to image about 35% of the sky, deep\n      into the universe. The survey measured the position and brightness of almost 1\n      billion objects, and obtained spectra to more than 4 million objects. This is\n      not an all-sky survey, so there are large parts of the sky that remain\n      unobserved, which produces the bow tie distribution and the black areas where\n      there surely are galaxies, but we have yet to observe them. These galaxies\n      appear to extend beyond the 2dF survey to distances that exceed 5 billion\n      light years. However, the weblike structure of clusters, filaments, and voids\n      seems to fade by about 2 billion light years. Beyond this distance, the\n      completeness of the survey drops so that only the intrinsically bright\n      galaxies are visible. The weblike cosmic structure is echoed in these data,\n      with orange clusters standing out among the less dense aqua-colored galaxies\n      and the less dense regions of green-colored galaxies.

This catalog\n      demonstrates the large-scale structure of the universe exceptionally well. And,\n      each galaxy has a representative image reflecting its morphological type, and is\n      properly sized and inclined. Size and shape. The data form a cube, which is an\n      arbitrary cutoff based on the completeness of these data. Beyond this, data from\n      these sources are not as reliable, so effort is made to show a complete picture,\n      albeit limited by observations (for example, we cannot see dwarf galaxies much\n      beyond the Local Group). The size of the cube is roughly 1 billion light years on\n      a diagonal (so the farthest galaxies in the dataset are about 1 billion light\n      years from the Milky Way), or about 700 million light years per side.\n      <br><br>Colors. Orange denotes more dense regions of the local universe, aqua is\n      given to galaxies in an intermediate-density area, and green is given to lower\n      density regions.(Description from URL) <br><br> Data Reference: Tully Galaxy\n      Catalog: Brent Tully (U Hawaii), Stuart Levy (NCSA/UIUC)","Name":"TullyGalaxies","Properties":[{"Description":"If this value is set to 'true', the screenspace-based properties are calculated at regular intervals.
